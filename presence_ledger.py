# =============================================================================
# presence_ledger.py — what we actually HAVE, decided at the moment it lands
# =============================================================================
# The tracker's episode grid is the master list of what is on disk. Everything
# downstream reads it: the grabber decides what to search for, requests decide
# when they are finished, and the user asks it what state their request is in.
# So the moment a download's files are placed, three things must happen, and
# until now only the first happened, and only sometimes:
#
#   1. REGISTER  every episode the placement supplied, into the grid. A season
#      pack registers every episode inside it, one row per episode.
#   2. REAP      every other download still in flight that this placement just
#      made pointless — never itself, never anything already finished.
#   3. SETTLE    the request: a movie is done on one file; a season is done
#      when its aired episode set is complete.
#
# Why this module exists: the old code did (1) only when the download row
# carried a show_id, and (3) only when it carried a request_id. A pack grabbed
# by hand has neither. Widow's Bay S01 landed complete on disk on 3 Sep and
# nothing recorded it, so the grid still read 0/10, the request never settled,
# and the grabber re-queued the same pack every five minutes for two hours and
# then queued all ten episodes individually. Registration now depends on the
# FILES, not on how the download happened to be started.
#
# Pure-ish: reads and writes the stores, never the network, never config.
